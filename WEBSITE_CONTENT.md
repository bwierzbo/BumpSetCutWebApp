## FAQ Section

### General Questions

#### What is BumpSetCut?
BumpSetCut is an iOS app that uses AI to automatically detect and extract volleyball rallies from your game videos. Instead of watching hours of footage, our computer vision technology finds the action for you.

#### How accurate is the rally detection?
Our CoreML model is trained specifically on volleyball footage and uses physics validation to ensure accurate rally boundaries. Detection accuracy is typically 90%+ for well-lit outdoor and indoor courts.

#### What video formats are supported?
BumpSetCut supports all standard iOS video formats (MOV, MP4, HEVC). Videos can be imported from your camera roll or recorded directly in the app (coming soon).

#### Does it work for both beach and indoor volleyball?
Yes! BumpSetCut automatically detects whether you're playing beach or indoor volleyball and adjusts detection accordingly.

#### Can I use it for practice footage?
Absolutely. BumpSetCut works on any volleyball video—matches, practices, drills, or scrimmages. The AI detects ball movement, not game context.

### Technical Questions

#### What devices are supported?
BumpSetCut requires iOS 17.0 or later. It works on iPhone 12 and newer models. iPad support coming soon.

#### Does it work offline?
Yes! Video processing happens entirely on your device using CoreML. No internet connection required for rally detection. Internet is only needed for uploading videos and accessing the community feed.

#### How long does processing take?
Processing time depends on video length and device. Typically, a 30-minute video processes in 5-10 minutes on an iPhone 14 or newer. Pro users get priority processing.

#### Where are my videos stored?
All videos are stored locally on your device. Processed rallies can be exported to your camera roll. If you share highlights to the community, they're hosted securely on Supabase cloud storage.

#### Does it drain my battery?
Video processing is CPU-intensive and will use battery. We recommend processing videos while charging. Once processed, viewing rallies uses minimal battery.

### Account & Billing

#### Is there a free trial?
Yes! The free plan includes 3 video processing credits per week with no time limit. Try it as long as you want.

#### What happens if I cancel my Pro subscription?
You keep all processed videos on your device. You'll revert to the free plan limits (3 videos/week, watermarks). Your community highlights remain public.

#### Can I get a refund?
Subscriptions are managed through the App Store. You can cancel anytime within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund. Contact Apple Support for refund requests.

#### Is there a team or coach discount?
Not yet, but we're working on team plans. Contact us at support@bumpsetcut.com if you're interested in bulk licensing.

### Privacy & Content

#### Who can see my videos?
Videos you process stay private on your device unless you choose to share highlights to the community feed. You control what gets shared.

#### Can I delete my account?
Yes. Go to Settings → Account → Delete Account. This removes all your data from our servers. Locally stored videos remain on your device until you delete the app.

#### How do you handle inappropriate content?
Users can report posts for spam, harassment, or inappropriate content. We review all reports within 24 hours. See our [Community Guidelines](https://bumpsetcut.com/community-guidelines) for details.

#### Do you sell my data?
Never. We don't sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. See our [Privacy Policy](https://bumpsetcut.com/privacy) for full details.

### Troubleshooting

#### Why isn't my video processing?
Common issues:
- **Video too large:** Free users have a 500MB limit
- **Low storage:** Processing requires 2x the original video size in free space
- **Unsupported format:** Use MOV or MP4 formats
- **Weekly limit reached:** Free users can process 3 videos per week

#### The AI missed some rallies. Why?
Rally detection works best with:
- Clear view of the court
- Good lighting (avoid heavy shadows)
- Ball visible in frame
- Minimal camera movement

If detection is inaccurate, try recording from a higher angle or with better lighting.

#### App crashes during processing. Help!
Try these steps:
1. Restart the app
2. Ensure you have 5GB+ free storage
3. Close other apps to free up RAM
4. Update to the latest iOS version
5. If issues persist, contact support@bumpsetcut.com

#### Can I re-process a video?
Currently, videos can only be processed once to prevent duplicate rallies. If you want to re-process with different settings, delete the original and re-import.
